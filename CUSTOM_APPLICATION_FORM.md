## üìÅ **Files Modified:**

- `src/client/src/orangehrmRecruitmentPlugin/pages/ApplyJobVacancy.vue`
  - Added all 7 sections from PSS application form
  - Added 100+ fields to the applicant model
  - Added validation rules for all fields
  - Added form fields in the template
  - Data is compiled and saved in the applicant's comments field

---

## üîß **To Apply Changes (Requires Frontend Rebuild):**

### **üöÄ Quick Rebuild (Recommended)**

Rebuild and restart the Docker container with the updated code:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NewtonLangidrik\Documents\Cursor\HRM\orangehrm-3

# Stop the current containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.no-nginx.yml --env-file env.no-nginx down

# Rebuild the OrangeHRM image with updated code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.no-nginx.yml --env-file env.no-nginx build --no-cache orangehrm

# Start the containers again
docker-compose -f docker-compose.no-nginx.yml --env-file env.no-nginx up -d
```

The rebuild process will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Build the main app frontend (including your custom application form)
3. Build the installer frontend
4. Create a new Docker image with all changes

**Expected time:** 5-10 minutes depending on your system

---

### **‚úÖ Verify Changes**

After rebuilding:
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
2. Navigate to Recruitment ‚Üí Vacancies
3. Create a test vacancy or open an existing one
4. Click "Apply" and you should see all 7 sections:
   - Section 1: Personal Details
   - Section 2: References (3 entries)
   - Section 3: Training/Workshops (4 entries)
   - Section 4: Formal Education (High Schools & Colleges)
   - Section 5: Hobbies, Sports & Special Skills
   - Section 6: Details of Employment (7 rows)
   - Section 7: Supporting Documents (7 Required + 2 Optional, with multi-file support)

---

### **üìù Alternative: Manual Frontend Build**

If you prefer to build the frontend separately:

```powershell
# Enter the running container
docker exec -it orangehrm_app bash

# Inside the container:
cd /var/www/html/src/client
yarn install
yarn build

# Exit container
exit

# Restart the app
docker-compose -f docker-compose.no-nginx.yml --env-file env.no-nginx restart orangehrm
```

---

## üéØ **Alternative: Use Custom Forms Plugin**

For now, you can:

1. **Collect additional info in the "Notes" field**
2. **Ask applicants to include details in their resume**
3. **Add custom questions in the job vacancy description**
4. **Use OrangeHRM's API to create custom intake forms**

---

## üìã **Current Form (Without Rebuild):**

The application form currently shows:
- Full Name
- Email
- Contact Number
- Resume Upload
- Keywords
- Notes ‚Üê Applicants can add extra info here
- Consent checkbox

---

## üîÑ **After Frontend Rebuild:**

The form will include all PSS personal details fields matching your template.

---

## üí° **Recommendation:**

Since rebuilding the frontend is complex and time-consuming, I recommend:

1. **For now**: Use the Notes field for additional information
2. **Provide instructions** in the job vacancy description
3. **Later**: Schedule a proper frontend rebuild when convenient

Or we can explore creating a separate custom intake form using PHP only (no JavaScript rebuild needed).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative: Create Custom PHP Form**

I can create a standalone custom PHP form that:
- Collects all PSS fields
- Stores data separately
- Links to OrangeHRM applicants
- Doesn't require frontend rebuild

Would you like me to create this instead?

---

**Let me know if you want to:**
A) Rebuild the frontend now (30-60 minutes)
B) Create a custom PHP form instead (15 minutes)
C) Use the Notes field for now and rebuild later
